    "* Its naive because it treats all word orders the same, high bias, low variance.\r\n",
    "* We take a prior probability and update it to get a posterior. \r\n",
    "eg. spam classification, we calculate conditional probability for each word|spam or not. \r\n",
    "* For any new word, we find prior for being normal, which is just the percentage of normal in training set. \r\n",
    "* We predict the class that has the higher posterior. \r\n",
