    "* We assume a simple constant velocity model. So we have eight states (u, v, a, h, u', v', a', h') u,v,a,h are centres and aspect ratios.\r\n",
    "* We also model process noise, measurement noise\r\n",
    "* Recursively we precidt the states and update them based on measurements, thus we infer new distribution from previous state distribution and measurement distribution.\r\n",
    "* Works best when Gaussian process is involved. \r\n",
